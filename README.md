A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that provides comprehensive access to NHL statistics, game data, and hockey analytics through a FastMCP-based interface.

## üèí Overview

This MCP server acts as a bridge between AI applications and NHL data sources, enabling seamless integration of hockey statistics, team information, player data, game schedules, and performance analytics into AI workflows and applications.

## ‚ú® Features
